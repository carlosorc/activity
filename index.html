<h1>Carlos Orcajo Bustamante. Champion Santander</h1>
<h2>Activity 2: Weekly Assignment - Design a logo for your Circular Maker Space</h2>
<p>I decided to use a mobile app to do the first design. I thought it was better because I could change details and concepts everywhere I was and then I could draw the definitive logo on the PC. I have used Canva app, It is very ease to put simple element and text to compound a logo and it is free in the initial version.
</p> 
<p>My logo is a representation of the sea of Santander, a kind of container and a mechanism. I want to represent the makers thinking of building for recycling and caring for the environement, the sea in this case.</p>
